## Object 
● The code becomes more transparent, easily understandable, and concise.

● The project represents a cohesive logical system, achieved by combining numerous related classes.

● Each class contains multiple methods that perform distinct behaviors unique to that class.

## Rules of the Game
● Planting and Defense: Players must plant various types of plants to prevent zombies from reaching the house.

● Sun Tokens: Used as in-game currency to buy plants, falling from the sky every few seconds in the day mode.

● Waiting Time: Each plant has a cooldown period before it can be planted again.

● Lawnmowers: Act as a last line of defense, activating once zombies reach the house, but can be used only once per row.

● Zombie Variations: Different types of zombies have varying defense and attack points, increasing in difficulty with each level.
